## Chapter 1: Atoms in Motion

All things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In one drop of water, there are more atoms than there are stars in the visible universe.

The atomic theory was first proposed by the ancient Greeks, but it was not until the 20th century that we truly understood the nature of atoms. An atom consists of a nucleus, made of protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons that orbit in discrete energy levels.

## Chapter 2: Basic Physics

Physics is the most fundamental and all-inclusive of the sciences. It has as its province the study of the behavior of the universe in all its aspects. The fundamental ideas of physics are the conservation laws: conservation of energy, conservation of momentum, and conservation of angular momentum.

Energy comes in many forms: kinetic energy (energy of motion), potential energy (stored energy), thermal energy, electrical energy, and mass energy (E=mc²). The total energy in a closed system remains constant, though it may change from one form to another.

## Chapter 3: The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences

Physics is the foundation of all natural sciences. Chemistry is essentially applied physics at the atomic and molecular level. Biology involves chemical processes which are ultimately physical processes. Even psychology and sociology have physical foundations in the workings of the brain and the behavior of large groups of people.

The most remarkable fact about nature is that everything follows simple mathematical laws. From the motion of planets to the behavior of subatomic particles, the universe operates according to precise, discoverable principles.

## Chapter 4: Conservation of Energy

Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This principle, known as the First Law of Thermodynamics, is one of the most fundamental laws in all of physics.

Consider a swinging pendulum. At the highest point of its swing, it has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy. At the lowest point, it has maximum kinetic energy and minimum potential energy. The total energy remains constant throughout the motion (ignoring friction).

## Chapter 5: The Theory of Gravitation

Newton's law of universal gravitation states that every particle attracts every other particle with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

F = G * (m₁ * m₂) / r²

This simple equation explains the motion of planets, the tides, and the falling of apples. Einstein later showed that gravity is not a force at all, but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.

## Chapter 6: Quantum Behavior

At the atomic scale, particles behave in ways that seem strange to our macroscopic intuition. Light behaves both as a wave and as a particle. Electrons do not have definite positions until they are measured. The act of observation affects the outcome.

Quantum mechanics, developed by Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and others, provides a mathematical framework for understanding these phenomena. The uncertainty principle states that certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, cannot both be precisely known.

## Chapter 7: The Principles of Statistical Mechanics

When dealing with large numbers of particles, we cannot track each one individually. Instead, we use statistical methods to predict the average behavior of the system.

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles. Heat flows from hot objects to cold objects because this increases the total entropy (disorder) of the system. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy always increases in closed systems."""

## Chapter 1: What Can Be Called into Doubt

Some years ago I was struck by the large number of falsehoods that I had accepted as true in my childhood, and by the highly doubtful nature of the whole edifice that I had subsequently based on them. I realized that it was necessary, once in the course of my life, to demolish everything completely and start again right from the foundations if I wanted to establish anything at all in the sciences that was stable and likely to last.

To do this, I need not show that all my opinions are false, which is probably impossible. But since the reason for my former beliefs were either the senses or the understanding, I must examine whether what the senses or the understanding tell me is reliable.

The senses sometimes deceive us. We have all seen straight sticks that appear bent in water. But perhaps they deceive us only about small or distant things, not about obvious matters. However, I must remember that I have dreams that are as vivid as waking life while I am in them. How can I be certain that I am not dreaming now?

## Chapter 2: The Nature of the Human Mind

Let us suppose, then, that I am dreaming, and that all these particulars—namely, that I open my eyes, move my head, extend my hands—are nothing but illusions. Let us suppose that I have no senses at all, that body, shape, extension, movement, and place are all chimeras.

What then will be true? Perhaps just the one thing that nothing is certain.

But how do I know there is not something different from all these things, something which cannot have the slightest doubt cast upon it? Is there not a God, or whatever I may call him, who puts into me the thoughts I am now having? But why should I think that, when I myself may be the author of these thoughts?

I must exist, at least when I think that I exist. Cogito, ergo sum—I think, therefore I am. This is the first and most certain knowledge that occurs to one who proceeds philosophically.

## Chapter 3: The Existence of God

I am a thinking thing, that is, a mind, an intellect, a reason, a being that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, and that also imagines and senses. But where do I get my idea of God?

By the word 'God' I understand a substance that is infinite, independent, supremely intelligent, and supremely powerful, and that created me and everything else that exists. The idea of God must have a cause, and the cause must contain at least as much reality as the effect.

I cannot be the cause of my own idea of God, because I am finite and imperfect, while the idea of God is of something infinite and perfect. Therefore, God must exist and must have placed this idea in me.

## Chapter 4: Truth and Falsity

I have been taught that God is not a deceiver. If God were a deceiver, he would not be perfect, for deception is an imperfection. Therefore, the faculty of knowledge that God has given me cannot be fundamentally deceptive, provided I use it correctly.

Clear and distinct perceptions are true. When I clearly and distinctly perceive something, I cannot help but believe it. And since God is not a deceiver, these perceptions must be true.

Error arises not from God's design but from my own misuse of my faculties. I have both a will and an understanding. The will is infinite in scope—I can affirm or deny any proposition. The understanding is finite—I do not know everything. Error occurs when the will affirms or denies what the understanding does not clearly know.

## Chapter 5: The Essence of Material Things

Having established the existence of God and the reliability of clear and distinct perceptions, I can now turn to the question of material things. Do they exist independent of my mind?

I have a faculty of imagination that is distinct from pure understanding. When I imagine a triangle, I do not merely understand what a triangle is; I picture it in my mind. This faculty seems to require something beyond my mind—perhaps the existence of bodies.

God has given me a strong inclination to believe that bodies exist. Since God is not a deceiver, this inclination must correspond to truth. Therefore, material things exist.

## Chapter 6: The Existence of Material Things

Material things exist, but they may not be exactly as the senses perceive them. The primary qualities of bodies—extension, shape, motion, number—are real properties of material things. The secondary qualities—colors, sounds, tastes, smells—exist only in the mind as sensations caused by the primary qualities.

A piece of wax, when heated, changes all its sensible qualities—its color, shape, texture, smell. Yet we still call it wax. What remains constant is its extension, its capacity to take various shapes, its flexibility. These are the true properties of the wax, independent of our perception.

The distinction between mind and body is complete. The mind is a thinking, unextended thing. The body is an extended, unthinking thing. They are distinct substances, though they interact in the human being."""

## Chapter 1: Of the Division of Labor

The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labor, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which it is anywhere directed, seem to have been the effects of the division of labor.

To take an example from a very trifling manufacture: the trade of a pin-maker. A workman not educated to this business could scarce make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But the way in which this business is now carried on, it is divided into about eighteen distinct operations.

One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head. Ten men, working in this manner, can make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day.

## Chapter 2: Of the Principle Which Gives Occasion to the Division of Labor

This division of labor is not originally the effect of any human wisdom, which foresees and intends that general opulence to which it gives occasion. It is the necessary, though very slow and gradual, consequence of a certain propensity in human nature: the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.

Nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another with another dog. But man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only.

He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest their self-love in his favor, and show them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.

## Chapter 3: Of the Natural and Market Price of Commodities

There is in every society or neighborhood an ordinary or average rate of wages and profit, which is naturally regulated by the quantity of stock and labor employed in the society.

When the quantity of any commodity which is brought to market falls short of the effectual demand, all those who are willing to pay the whole value of the rent, wages, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it thither, cannot be supplied with the quantity which they want. Rather than want it altogether, some of them will be willing to give more.

A competition will immediately begin among them, and the market price will rise more or less above the natural price, according as either the greatness of the deficiency, or the wealth and wanton luxury of the competitors, happen to animate more or less the eagerness of the competition.

## Chapter 4: Of the Wages of Labor

The produce of labor constitutes the natural recompense or wages of labor. In that original state of things which precedes both the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock, the whole produce of labor belongs to the laborer.

As soon as land becomes private property, the landlord demands a share of almost all the produce which the laborer can either raise or collect from it. His rent makes the first deduction from the produce of the labor which is employed upon land.

The wages of labor are the encouragement of industry, which, like every other human quality, improves in proportion to the encouragement it receives. A plentiful subsistence increases the bodily strength of the laborer, and the comfortable hope of bettering his condition animates him to exert that strength to the utmost.

## Chapter 5: Of the Profits of Stock

The profits of stock, it may perhaps be thought, are only a different name for the wages of a particular sort of labor, the labor of inspection and direction. They are, however, altogether different.

The profits of stock vary with the price of the commodities in which it is employed. As the price of any commodity rises above the natural rate, the profits of stock in that particular trade rise above the ordinary rate. As capital flows into the trade, the supply increases and the price falls.

In general, the profits of stock are highest in countries that are going fastest to ruin. The interest of the dealers in any particular branch of trade or manufactures is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public.

## Chapter 6: Of the Rent of Land

The rent of land is the price paid for the use of land. It is naturally the highest which the tenant can afford to pay in the actual circumstances of the land. After deducting the expense of cultivation, what remains is the rent.

Rent enters into the composition of the price of commodities in a different way from wages and profit. High or low wages and profit are the causes of high or low price; high or low rent is the effect of it.

As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce.

## Chapter 7: Of the Accumulation of Capital

Capital is increased by parsimony and diminished by prodigality and misconduct. Whatever a person saves from his revenue he adds to his capital, and either employs it himself in maintaining an additional number of productive hands, or enables some other person to do so.

The annual produce of the land and labor of any nation can be increased in its value by no other means but by increasing either the number of its productive laborers, or the productive power of those laborers who had before been employed.

The quantity of capital is limited by the quantity of produce that can be saved. The quantity of produce that can be saved is limited by the quantity that can be consumed. Therefore, the desire of food is limited in every man by the narrow capacity of the human stomach."""

## Chapter 1: The Characters of the Story

The mind operates in two distinct modes. I call them System 1 and System 2 for convenience. System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations.

When we think of ourselves, we identify with System 2, the conscious, reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do. Although System 2 believes itself to be where the action is, the automatic System 1 is the hero of this book.

System 1 generates impressions and feelings that are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. The automatic operations of System 1 generate surprisingly complex patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps.

## Chapter 2: Attention and Effort

System 2 is the only one that can follow rules, compare objects on several attributes, and make deliberate choices between options. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.

When we are engaged in effortful mental activity, our pupils dilate. The pupil is a good indicator of the physical arousal that accompanies mental effort. As you carry out a task that requires mental effort, your pupils will dilate and will remain dilated until you finish.

System 2 has limited capacity. When we are engaged in effortful mental activity, we have less capacity available for other tasks. This is why we cannot carry on two conversations at once, or why we may fail to notice a car slowing down while we are talking on the phone.

## Chapter 3: The Lazy Controller

System 2 is lazy. It often adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification. When all goes smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification.

However, System 2 is capable of overriding System 1 when it detects an error. This is why we can recognize and correct our mistakes. But this override requires effort and attention, and System 2 is often too lazy to engage.

The law of least effort applies to cognitive as well as physical exertion. People will gravitate to the least demanding course of action. In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs.

## Chapter 4: The Associative Machine

System 1 represents categories by prototypes. It computes norms and prototypes, and it integrates information about multiple attributes. System 1 is remarkably capable in one particular skill: associative memory.

Ideas that have been evoked trigger many other ideas, in a spreading cascade of activity in your brain. The essential feature of this complex set of mental events is its coherence. Each element is connected, and each supports and strengthens the others.

The word 'vomit' triggers a host of responses. You may have winced a little, and your facial expression may have changed. You may have experienced a slight wave of nausea. This is the associative machinery of System 1 at work.

## Chapter 5: Cognitive Ease

The familiarity of one phrase in the statement sufficed to make the whole statement feel familiar, and therefore true. This is the illusion of truth. Repetition induces cognitive ease and a comforting feeling of familiarity.

When you feel strained, you are more likely to be vigilant and suspicious. When you feel comfortable and fluent, you are more likely to accept things as they are. Cognitive ease is both a cause and a consequence of a pleasant feeling.

People tend to be more creative and intuitive when they are in a good mood. A good mood signals that things are generally going well, the environment is safe, and it is okay to let your guard down.

## Chapter 6: Norms, Surprises, and Causes

System 1 is designed to jump to conclusions from little evidence. It is designed to make guesses about the nature of the world based on limited information. These guesses are often correct, but sometimes they lead to systematic errors.

The mind is strongly biased toward causal explanations. It does not deal well with mere statistics. We are pattern seekers, believers in a coherent world, in which regularities appear not by accident but as a result of mechanical causality or of someone's intention.

We are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see. The exaggerated faith of small samples is only one example of a general illusion: we focus on the content of the message and ignore information about its reliability.

## Chapter 7: A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions

System 1 is a machine for jumping to conclusions. It constructs the best possible story from the information available, and it does so with little regard for the quality or completeness of the evidence.

The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little. We often fail to allow for the possibility that evidence that should be critical to our judgment is missing.

The associative system searches for coherence. It is designed to make sense of the world, to construct a coherent story from the available information. When the information is scanty, it fills in the gaps with plausible guesses.

## Chapter 8: How Judgments Happen

System 2 is capable of endorsing or rejecting the intuitive beliefs of System 1. However, System 2 is often busy, lazy, or distracted, and it may endorse the intuitive judgment without much scrutiny.

The division of labor between System 1 and System 2 is highly efficient. System 1 does most of the work, and System 2 takes over when things get difficult. This arrangement minimizes effort and maximizes performance.

However, the arrangement is not perfect. System 1 has biases and systematic errors. When System 2 fails to detect these errors, we make mistakes. Understanding these mistakes is the first step toward avoiding them."""
